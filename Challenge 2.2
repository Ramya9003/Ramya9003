Python Program to Solve Quadratic Equation
To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics:

Python Data Types
Python Basic Input and Output
Python Operators
The standard form of a quadratic equation is:

ax2 + bx + c = 0, where
a, b and c are real numbers and
a ≠ 0
The solutions of this quadratic equation is given by:

(-b ± (b ** 2 - 4 * a * c) ** 0.5) / (2 * a)
Source Code
# Solve the quadratic equation ax**2 + bx + c = 0

# import complex math module
import cmath

a = 1
b = 5
c = 6

# calculate the discriminant
d = (b**2) - (4*a*c)

# find two solutions
sol1 = (-b-cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)
sol2 = (-b+cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)

print('The solution are {0} and {1}'.format(sol1,sol2))
Run Code
Output

Enter a: 1
Enter b: 5
Enter c: 6
The solutions are (-3+0j) and (-2+0j)
We have imported the cmath module to perform complex square root. First, we calculate the discriminant and then find the two solutions of the quadratic equation.

You can change the value of a, b and c in the above program and test this program.
