To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics:

Python if...else Statement
Python Basic Input and Output
In the program below, the three numbers are stored in num1, num2 and num3 respectively. We've used the if...elif...else ladder to find the largest among the three and display it.

Source Code
# Python program to find the largest number among the three input numbers

# change the values of num1, num2 and num3
# for a different result
num1 = 10
num2 = 14
num3 = 12

# uncomment following lines to take three numbers from user
#num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
#num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
#num3 = float(input("Enter third number: "))

if (num1 >= num2) and (num1 >= num3):
   largest = num1
elif (num2 >= num1) and (num2 >= num3):
   largest = num2
else:
   largest = num3

print("The largest number is", largest)
Run Code
Output

The largest number is 14.0
Note: To test the program, change the values of num1, num2 and num3.
